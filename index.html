								<b> I am a cosmological data scientist with a deep interest in exploring the universe through big data. My academic journey, including my Master's in Gravitation and Cosmology from the University of Zanjan, has equipped me with hands-on experience in observational astronomy, data analysis, and developing ML/DL algorithms for galaxy classification. 
									As part of my work, I developed the <a href="https://pypi.org/project/ZEMO/"> ZEMO Python package </a>, based on Zernike moments, to automate the classification of galactic structures.
									My research focuses on applying machine learning and deep learning to solve complex problems in cosmology by designing innovative AI architectures. 
									In addition to my cosmological work, I have also applied my AI expertise to analyze financial markets in a contract project.
									Currently, I am seeking opportunities to pursue a PhD and work as a research assistant within computational cosmology groups at top universities around the world. 
									I am excited to leverage my skills in data science, AI, and astronomy to contribute to cutting-edge research in this rapidly evolving field.
